... `astsa` is the R package to accompany the [Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-52452-8) text, [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/)  and the [Chapman & Hall](https://www.routledge.com/Time-Series-A-Data-Analysis-Approach-Using-R/Shumway-Stoffer/p/book/9780367221096) text  [Time Series: A Data Analysis Approach using R](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsda/). 


We won't always push the latest version of the package to CRAN, but [the latest working version of the package will always be at Github](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/).

* See the [NEWS for further details about the state of the package, how to install the latest version, and the changelog](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/NEWS.md).


* A list of data sets, scripts, and demonstrations of the capabilities of `astsa` can be found  at
[FUN WITH ASTSA](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/fun_with_astsa/fun_with_astsa.md)...  it's more fun than high school.


* The updated [code for the graduate level text](https://github.com/nickpoison/tsa4/blob/master/textRcode.md) is here: [TSA4](https://github.com/nickpoison/tsa4/blob/master/textRcode.md).

* The updated [code for the data science text](https://github.com/nickpoison/tsda/blob/master/Rcode.md) is here: [TSDA](https://github.com/nickpoison/tsda/blob/master/Rcode.md).

* Python

   - The [code in the first 3 chapters of the Springer text has been converted to Python here.](https://github.com/borisgarbuzov/tsa4-python/tree/master/src) 

   - And a [Python package that contains datasets from astsa is here.](https://pypi.org/project/astsadata/)

The Springer text was written under version 1.8 and the Chapman & Hall text was written under version 1.9. Later versions will work for both texts with only some minor changes in output that won't affect any of the data analysis.
