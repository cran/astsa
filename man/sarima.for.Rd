sarima.for(xdata, n.ahead, p, d, q, P = 0, D = 0, Q = 0, S = -1, 
            tol = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps), no.constant = FALSE,

\arguments{
  \item{xdata}{univariate time series
%%     ~~Describe \code{xdata} here~~
}
  \item{n.ahead}{forecast horizon (number of periods)
%%     ~~Describe \code{n.ahead} here~~
}
  \item{p}{AR order
%%     ~~Describe \code{p} here~~
}
  \item{d}{difference order
%%     ~~Describe \code{d} here~~
}
  \item{q}{MA order
%%     ~~Describe \code{q} here~~
}
  \item{P}{SAR order; use only for seasonal models 
%%     ~~Describe \code{P} here~~
}
  \item{D}{seasonal difference; use only for seasonal models
%%     ~~Describe \code{D} here~~
}
  \item{Q}{SMA order; use only for seasonal models
%%     ~~Describe \code{Q} here~~
}
  \item{S}{seasonal period; use only for seasonal models 
%%     ~~Describe \code{S} here~~
}
  \item{tol}{controls the relative tolerance (reltol) used to assess convergence. The default is \code{sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)}, the R default.
%%     ~~Describe \code{tol} here~~
}
  \item{no.constant}{controls whether or not a constant is included in the model. If \code{no.constant=TRUE}, no constant is included in the model.
   See  \code{\link{sarima}} for more details.
%%     ~~Describe \code{no.constant} here~~
}
  \item{plot.all}{if TRUE, all the data are plotted in the graphic; otherwise, only the last 100 observations are plotted in the graphic.
%%   
}
\item{xreg}{Optionally, a vector or matrix of external regressors, which must have the same number of rows as the series.  If this
is used, \code{newxreg} MUST be specified.
%%   
}
\item{newxreg}{New values of \code{xreg} to be used for prediction. Must have at least \code{n.ahead} rows.
%%   
}
}

\details{For example, \code{sarima.for(x,5,1,0,1)} will forecast five time points ahead for an ARMA(1,1) fit to x. The output prints the forecasts and the standard errors of the forecasts, and supplies a graphic of the forecast with +/- 1 and 2 prediction error bounds.
