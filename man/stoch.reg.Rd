\description{Performs frequency domain stochastic regression discussed in Chapter 7.  
}
\usage{
stoch.reg(xdata, cols.full, cols.red=NULL, alpha, L, M, plot.which, col.resp=NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{xdata}{data matrix with the last column being the response variable
}
  \item{cols.full}{specify columns of data matrix that are in the full model
}
  \item{cols.red}{specify columns of data matrix that are in the reduced model (use NULL if there are no inputs in the reduced model) 
}
  \item{alpha}{test size; number between 0 and 1
}
  \item{L}{odd integer specifying degree of smoothing  
}
  \item{M}{number (integer) of points in the discretization of the integral
}
  \item{plot.which}{\code{coh} or \code{F.stat}, to plot either the squared-coherencies or the F-statistics, respectively
}
  \item{col.resp}{specify column of the response variable if it is not the last column of
    the data matrix
}
  \item{\dots}{additional graphic arguments
}
}
\details{
This function computes the spectral matrix, F statistics and coherences, and plots them.
Returned as well are the coefficients in the impulse response function.

Enter, as the argument to this function, the full data matrix, and then the labels of the 
columns of input series in the "full" and "reduced" regression models - enter NULL if there 
are no inputs under the reduced model. 

If the response variable is the LAST column of the data matrix, it need not be specified. Otherwise specify which column holds the responses as \code{col.resp}.

Other inputs are alpha (test size), L (smoothing), M (number 
of points in the discretization of the integral)  and plot.which = "coh" 
or "F", to plot either the coherences or the F statistics.

\value{\item{power.full }{spectrum under the full model}
\item{power.red }{spectrum under the reduced model}
\item{Betahat }{regression parameter estimates}
\item{eF }{pointwise (by frequency) F-tests}
\item{coh }{coherency}
