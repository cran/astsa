\title{Frequency Domain Stochastic Regression
} 
\description{Performs frequency domain stochastic regression discussed in Chapter 7.  
}
\usage{
stoch.reg(data, cols.full, cols.red, alpha, L, M, plot.which)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{data matrix
}
  \item{cols.full}{specify columns of data matrix that are in the full model
}
  \item{cols.red}{specify columns of data matrix that are in the reduced model (use NULL if there are no inputs in the reduced model) 
}
  \item{alpha}{test size
}
  \item{L}{smoothing - see \code{spans} in \code{spec.pgram}
}
  \item{M}{number of points in the discretization of the integral
}
  \item{plot.which}{\code{coh} or \code{F.stat}, to plot either the squared-coherencies or the F-statistics, respectively
}
}
\value{\item{power.full }{spectrum under the full model}
\item{power.red }{spectrum under the reduced model}
\item{Betahat }{regression parameter estimates}
\item{eF }{pointwise (by frequency) F-tests}
\item{coh }{coherency}
}
