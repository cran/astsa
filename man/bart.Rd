\title{
Bartlett Kernel
}
\description{
Smoothing (triangular) kernel that decreases one unit from the center.
}
\usage{
bart(m)
}
\arguments{
  \item{m}{non-negative integer specifying the kernel width, which is \code{2m + 1}.  If \code{m} has length larger than one, the convolution of the kernel is returned.
}
}
\details{
Uses \code{kernel} from the \code{stats} package to construct a Bartlett (triangular) kernel of width \code{2m + 1}; see \code{help(kernel)} for further details.
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{tskernel} with the coefficients, the kernel dimension, and attribute  "Bartlett".
