\title{Estimate Trend
}
\description{
Estimates the trend (polynomial or lowess) of a time series and returns a graphic of the series with the trend and error bounds superimposed.
}
\usage{
trend(series, order = 1, lowess = FALSE, lowspan = 2/3, col = c(4, 6), ylab = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{series}{
The time series to be analyzed (univariate only).
}
  \item{order}{
Order of the polynomial used to estimate the trend with a linear default (order=1) unless \code{lowess} is TRUE.
}
  \item{lowess}{
If TRUE, lowess is used to find the trend. The default is FALSE.
}
  \item{lowspan}{
The smoother span used for lowess.
}
  \item{col}{
For the graphic, the color of the data (default is 4) and the color of the trend (default is 6).
}
  \item{ylab}{
Label for the vertical axis (default is the name of the series).
}
  \item{\dots}{
Other graphical parameters.
}
}
\details{
Produces a graphic of the time series with the trend and a .95 pointwise confidence interval superimposed. The trend estimate and the error bounds are returned invisibly.
}
\value{
Produces a graphic and returns the trend estimate and error bounds invisibly (see details).
