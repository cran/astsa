\details{Multiple time series consisting of fMRI BOLD signals at eight locations (in columns 2-9, column 1 is time period), when a stimulus was applied for 32 seconds and then stopped for 32 seconds. The signal period is 64 seconds and the sampling rate was one observation every 2 seconds for 256 seconds (\eqn{n = 128}).  The columns are labeled: "time" "cort1" "cort2" "cort3"  "cort4"   "thal1"   "thal2"  "cere1"  "cere2".
