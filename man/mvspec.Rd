\title{Univariate and Multivariate Spectral Estimation
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{This is \code{spec.pgram} with a few changes in the defaults and written so you can easily extract the estimate of the multivariate spectral matrix as \code{fxx}.  The bandwidth calculation has been changed to the more practical definition given in the text. Can be used to replace \code{spec.pgram} for univariate series.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\details{This is \code{spec.pgram} with a few changes in the defaults and written so you can easily extract the estimate of the multivariate spectral matrix as \code{fxx}. The default for the plot is NOT to plot on a log scale and the graphic will have a grid. The bandwidth calculation has been changed to the more practical definition given in the text, \eqn{(L_h/n.used)*frequency(x)}. Although meant to be used to easily obtain multivariate spectral estimates, this script can be used for univariate time series.  Note that the script does not taper by default (\code{taper=0}); this forces the user to do "conscious tapering".

\value{An object of class "spec", which is a list containing at least the following components:

\item{fxx }{spectral matrix estimates; an array of dimensions \code{dim = c(p,p,nfreq)}}
\item{freq }{vector of frequencies at which the spectral density is estimated.}
\item{spec }{vector (for univariate series) or matrix (for multivariate series) of estimates of the spectral density at frequencies corresponding to freq.}
\item{details }{matrix with columns: frequency, period, spectral ordinate(s)}
\item{coh }{NULL for univariate series. For multivariate time series, a matrix containing the squared coherency between different series. Column i + (j - 1) * (j - 2)/2 of coh contains the squared coherency between columns i and j of x, where i < j.}
\item{phase }{NULL for univariate series. For multivariate time series a matrix containing the cross-spectrum phase between different series. The format is the same as coh.}
\item{Lh }{Number of frequencies (approximate) used in the band, as defined in Chapter 4.}
\item{n.used }{Sample length used for the FFT}
\item{series }{The name of the time series.}
\item{snames }{For multivariate input, the names of the component series.}
\item{method }{The method used to calculate the spectrum.}

The results are returned invisibly if plot is true.
